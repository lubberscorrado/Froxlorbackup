Froxlorbackup
=============

Backup your Froxlor Webhosting to another server. Encrypted, via ssh.

Works until version 0.9.32.

SQL works now also for Versions > 0.9.32.
HTML is planned to be backed up with duplicity

The decrypt.sh file has just two lines. With them you can decrypt and untar your backups as long as they are back on the local storage.
For $encrypt in this file use the same path as you do in any other file
